L07 - But These Go Up To Eleven
2022-03-18
Time spent: 3.9 hrs

EXPERIENCES:
The lab was somewhat frustrating.
Most of the subjects in the lab was already known way ahead of time, and most of the algorithms were straight out given to us.
This made completing the lab feel more like busy work instead of problem solving.
However, there were a few moments that we found interesting, like the error code we got from attempting to map a quotation mark character in Activity 3 question 1 (see comment).
We also found the arePermutation method being possible without the prerequisites interesting, as we thought about how to use a sort to solve the problem with duplicates.
In the end, we decided to just cut the activity off after Activity 3, because we have already been working on it for an hour.
