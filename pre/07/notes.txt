07: Arrays
  Oh boy, this is where the insanity started setting in. 
  6/10, been a while since I used arrays, I did need a refresher, but the assignment itself was, in my opinion, flawed because of the fact that the file was going to be named "Arrays", which would cause a namespace conflict with the java class Arrays.
  I got really tipped off coding this. You will see that. 
  Sorry. 
  
  However, I think it's worth keeping in the document just to keep it forever set in stone.
