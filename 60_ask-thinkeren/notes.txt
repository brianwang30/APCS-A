Time Spent:

DISCO: We are a very disorganized class.
QCC: Isn't a deck of cards 52 cards? We only have 32 (I think) people. How could we have possibly made it work?

Our attempts at sorting the deck was... a disaster.
There are many reasons for this.
* A lot (maybe too much) of talking, but still too little communication.
* Bad organization. Nobody really followed a pattern when passing on their cards. They just tossed them about.
* Lots of people forgot who gave them cards, since the people giving them cards were often in themselves pilgrims from a faraway land. 
* Very had to move around the room, even harder to pass out cards in a smart order.
In the end, we were unsuccessful.

Maybe if we make a more organized way to pass out cards.
Even more organized than raising and holding out hands.
Like a specific order to give out cards.

From what I gathered, this sort appears to be some sort of recursive sort, constantly calling itself on a list of items until the list inputted is of length 1.
Then, working backwards, each single element is sorted by the previous call, creating many but small sorted lists.
Then, as with the algos we wrote in class about creating a sorted list from two lists, the once again previous call would assemble a new longer list with all the elements in it, but sorted.
Rinse and repeat, working backwards, until only the original list remains, but sorted.
This did not quite happen in class.
