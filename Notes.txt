2021--09--28
FOR REFERENCE ONLY


00: BeforeYouCode
  10/10, mostly just goes over the basics of coding, already covered in Intro. 
01: HelloWorld
  9/10, didn't usually use terminal to run my java code as I used eclipse prior to this, but once again, this process was more or less covered in Intro so it wasn't a challenge. 
02: DataTypes
  10/10, already knew the nuances about datatypes when coding in java. 
03: VoidMethods
  10/10, already knew about how to return values in java, and about void methods. 
04: Conditionals
  10/10, ideas were more or less already covered in Intro, along with my previous java experience. 
05: ValueMethods
  10/10, many ideas were covered in Intro, just applied to java. 
06: Loops
  9/10, just about everything was already practiced in python and racket from Intro, the only new addition I picked up from this was an enhanced for loop, which I found convenient. 
07: Arrays
  6/10, been a while since I used arrays, I did need a refresher, but the assignment itself was, in my opinion, flawed because of the fact that the file was going to be named "Arrays", which would cause a namespace conflict with the java class Arrays.
Codingbat:
  10/10, most of the exercises were extremely simple.
